Super Contact Form is a simple, highly extensible XHTML contact form featuring spam-reduction measures, GUI customization, and shortcode-based insertion.

== Description ==

Super Contact Form is a simple contact form that utilizes a highly semantic, XHTML-based contact form you can insert using `[easy-contact] on any page or post.

Super Contact Form features spam-reduction measures, GUI-based customization, carbon copying option, and more. Emails include tracked referrer information, including keywords for search-based landings, user agent, and IP.

Super Contact Form is for WordPress and features:

* Out-of-the-box function using shortcode without editing any files
* Options menu for complete customization of form content
* Spam reduction measures, i.e., math- and/or challenge-based question
* Secure plugin operation and highly semantic XHTML
* Use of the Sandbox comment form design patterns
* An included starter CSS file with corresponding images
* Tracked information, e.g., user agent, user referrers, IP

Based partially on the classic [WP Contact Form](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-contact-form/ "WP Contact Form for WordPress"), Easy Contact includes newer WordPress features (e.g., shortcode) and greatly improved form security. Easy Contact is just another contact form, except built with clean XHTML and improved security.

== Installation ==

This plugin is installed just like any other WordPress plugin. More [detailed installation instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins "Installing Plugins - WordPress Codex") are available on the WordPress Codex.

== Use ==

After activating this plugin, simply use the shortcode `[easy-contact]` wherever you want the Super Contact Form. This shortcode takes no attributes.

`[easy-contact]`


You will also want to customize the Super Contact Form plugin from the *Settings > Contact* options menu. Here you can set the email address to receive submissions, text for legends, labels, and prompts, turn on spam reduction measure(s), etc.

Included with Super Contact Form is a example style sheet file with images. Super Contact Form features dynamic classes, so when an input field is returned to the user for an error-related issue, the input is given the class `error`, etc.

And so on. A very simple plugin.
