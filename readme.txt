Super Contact Form Plugin.

== Description ==

Super Contact Form is a simple contact form that utilizes a highly semantic, XHTML-based contact form you can insert using [easy-contact] on any page or post.

For a demo, visit [Detox Diet](http://www.detoxdietabc.com "Detox Diet"), where you will find it, fully funcional.

Super Contact Form features spam-reduction measures, GUI-based customization, carbon copying option, and more. Emails include tracked referrer information, including keywords for search-based landings, user agent, and IP.

Super Contact Form is for WordPress and features:

* Out-of-the-box function using shortcode without editing any files
* Options menu for complete customization of form content
* Spam reduction measures, i.e., math- and/or challenge-based question
* Secure plugin operation and highly semantic XHTML
* Use of the Sandbox comment form design patterns
* An included starter CSS file with corresponding images
* Tracked information, e.g., user agent, user referrers, IP

Based partially on the classic WP Contact Form, Super Contact Form includes newer WordPress features (e.g., shortcode) and greatly improved form security. Easy Contact is just another contact form, except built with clean XHTML and improved security.

You will also want to customize the Super Contact Form plugin from the *Settings > Contact* options menu. Here you can set the email address to receive submissions, text for legends, labels, and prompts, turn on spam reduction measure(s), etc.

Included with Super Contact Form is a example style sheet file with images. Super Contact Form features dynamic classes, so when an input field is returned to the user for an error-related issue, the input is given the class `error`, etc.

And so on. A very simple plugin.
